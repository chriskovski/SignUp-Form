# SignUp-Form
A quick project for a "One-Pager", which consists only of a Sign-Up Form.

# Description
This was an exercise following the "The Odin Project"-Path in becoming a web developer.

In this Project, I practiced & strenghtend my skills in making a HTML-form with all the semantics, and I also learned and practiced a lot about responsiveness in CSS. I can feel, that with each Project, my skills regarding a responsive Website get better and better. I can finish projects including only HTML & CSS fairly quickly and reliable. Of course it's still far from perfect, but I'm on my way to getting pretty good in HTML & CSS, regarding that this was an "intermediate" level HTML project.
